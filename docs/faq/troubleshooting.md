# Troubleshooting Guide

If your theme does not behave as expected, use the following troubleshooting steps before requesting support.

---

## 1. Clear Cache

- Clear browser cache and cookies.  
- Hard-refresh the page (`Ctrl + F5` or `Cmd + Shift + R`).  
- Try using another browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

---

## 2. Check for JavaScript Errors

- Open **Developer Tools → Console**.  
- Look for red error messages — they may indicate missing assets or syntax issues.  
- Disable custom scripts one by one to find the culprit.

---

## 3. Verify Theme Files

- Go to **Online Store → Themes → Edit Code**.  
- Check that all folders (`/sections`, `/snippets`, `/assets`) exist.  
- Compare against a clean theme version if files are missing.

---

## 4. Isolate Custom Code

- Temporarily remove or comment out recent custom code changes.  
- Test the site after each removal to identify conflicts.  
- Reapply only stable modifications once verified.

---

## 5. Reinstall the Theme

If problems persist after extensive debugging:

1. Download the latest theme package.  
2. Re-upload and publish a fresh copy.  
3. Reapply your customizations gradually.

## 6. Use Shopify Theme Inspector

- Install the **Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome** extension.  
- Analyze Liquid rendering time and identify bottlenecks.  
- Review template performance under “Timeline” tab.

## 7. Contact Support
