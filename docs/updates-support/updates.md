## How to Check for Updates

1. Visit the **Shopify Theme Store** or your theme’s product page.  
2. Check the “Version” number under your purchase details.  
3. Compare it with your installed theme version (found in `theme.liquid` comments or under **Theme Settings → About**).

2. **Upload the New Theme**  
   Go to **Online Store → Themes → Add Theme → Upload Zip File**.

### Option 2 — Theme Updater App (Optional)

Some vendors provide an updater app for one-click theme updates.  
If available for ESEN, follow the vendor instructions to safely migrate customizations.

## Post-Update Checks

After updating, verify:
- Custom sections and metafields are functioning.  
- No Liquid errors appear in the console.  
- Translations remain intact.  
- Images and assets load properly.

## Backup Best Practices

Before updating:
1. Duplicate your current theme (Actions → Duplicate).  
2. Rename the copy as `Backup - [date]`.  
3. Download a ZIP file for offline storage.

This ensures you can roll back easily if any issue occurs.
