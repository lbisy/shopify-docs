# One-Click Demo Import

Our theme provides a **one-click demo import** feature, which allows you to quickly replicate the demo site on your own WordPress installation. This saves you time and helps you understand how the theme works.

## Steps to Import

1. Navigate to your WordPress Dashboard → **Appearance → Import Demo Data**.
2. Click on the **Import Demo** button.
3. Wait until the process completes. Do not close your browser tab during this step.
4. Once finished, you will see a success message and your site will look like the demo.

## Notes

- The import process may take several minutes depending on your server speed.
- If your server has **low PHP limits** (e.g., `max_execution_time` or `memory_limit`), the import may fail.  
  Please check the [Requirements](../getting-started/requirements.md).
