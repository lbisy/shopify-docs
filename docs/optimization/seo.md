# SEO Optimization

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) ensures your Shopify store is visible and ranks well in search results.  
Proper use of metadata, headings, and structured data enhances organic traffic.

## Metadata & Titles

- Use descriptive **page titles** and **meta descriptions**.  
- Configure default values in `theme.liquid` using `{{ page_title }}` and `{{ shop.meta_description }}`.  
- Allow merchants to edit meta titles and descriptions via **Theme Settings**.

## Structured Data (Schema Markup)

- Include **JSON-LD schema** for products, articles, and breadcrumbs.  
- Shopify automatically provides some schema, but you can extend it for custom objects.  
- Validate structured data with **Google Rich Results Test**.

## Headings & Content Hierarchy

- Maintain a logical order of headings: `h1` for main titles, `h2–h4` for subsections.  
- Avoid duplicate `h1` elements on a single page.  
- Use clear, keyword-focused headings for readability.

## URLs & Navigation

- Keep URLs clean, readable, and consistent.  
- Ensure that navigation menus are crawlable and not hidden behind scripts.  
- Avoid excessive redirects or broken links.

## Alt Text & Media

- Provide descriptive `alt` attributes for all images.  
- Avoid keyword stuffing; focus on describing the image accurately.  
- Add transcripts for embedded videos when applicable.

## Performance & Mobile

- Page speed and mobile responsiveness directly impact SEO.  
- Use **responsive images** and **mobile-first design** principles.  
- Regularly test using Google’s **Mobile-Friendly Test**.

## Summary

Good SEO practices make your theme discoverable and merchant-friendly.  
Design every template with clean, semantic HTML and performance in mind.
